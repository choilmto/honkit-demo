## Phase 3: Onboarding
Once the Mentee has been selected, our aim is to transition that person smoothly onto the Team and ensure a good fit. The MT will gather feedback, give recommendations, and potentially provide an alternative Mentee in the event the first isnâ€™t working out.

**Note**: It is not recommended to add the Mentee to the specific channel you will be communicating with us on. 

1. Schedule Meeting
  * Reach out to Mentee for introductions and set quarterly 3 month goal
    * Detail milestones along the way
  * Set 1st quick win
  * Set time for weekly check in

2. Weekly Check-in
  * Monitor progress towards goal
  * Answer questions
  * Ask how previous or ongoing task is going
  * Answer any questions  
  * Set new tasks for things to work on
