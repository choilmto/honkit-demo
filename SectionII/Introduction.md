# Introduction

The mission of the Mentorship Team (MT) is to help other Teams within Node.js acquire Mentees and assist in transitioning them into long-term Members of those Teams. We are actively developing a process to facilitate that mission in a streamlined fashion. This section of the Onboarding Guide is meant to provide you, the Mentor, with the necessary knowledge to participate effectively and easily in that process.

**Note**: Please refer to the Glossary at the end of the Onboarding Guide if you see terms or abbreviations youâ€™re not familiar with in this section.
