# Step 2: Opening Dialogue (Week 2)

## Motivation
There is a lot of communication involved in creating a Position and finding and onboarding a Mentee. We need a form of communication that is searchable, organized, and focused so that it doesnâ€™t become cumbersome to work with several Teams at once.

## Procedure
Once a Team has confirmed interest in participating in the Program, the MT will create a Working Channel. Once created, all written communication between the MT and the Mentor will be handled through this channel.

## Notes
* Are there some things that should fall outside the Slack channel and use email instead?
* Is there a reason for video calls in some cases?
