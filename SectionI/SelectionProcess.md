# Step 7: Selection Process (Week 7)

## Motivation
With a reasonable amount of Applicants collected, it is time to select the most suitable Candidates and Mentee(s) from the pool.

## Procedure
1. Any new (non-highlighted) Applicants since the last filtering round are filtered using the same procedure.
2. If, after filtering, the MT decides there are not enough Candidates, the MT may decide to extend the Application Period. If so, the extension is announced through the usual channels.
3. Once enough Candidates are collected, the selection process can begin.
4. The Candidates are split evenly among the present MT members. Each member is assigned a color and the rows on the Applicants results spreadsheet are highlighted those colors.
5. Each member evaluates the assigned Candidates and chooses a favorite Candidate.
6. Once all present members have chosen a favorite Candidate, time is given for each member to study the other members’ favorite Candidates and choose a favorite from among all the favorites.
7. Once all present members have selected a final favorite Candidate, a message in the MT Channel is created with the format “<Mentor’s Team Name> Selection”.
8. Each member types - but does not send - the name of that member’s favorite Candidate as a reply to that message. After a verbal countdown, all members submit their response simultaneously. The Candidate with the most votes becomes the Selected Mentee.
9. In the case where there is a tie, each member will give their pros and cons to the selected Mentees and deliberate until a selection is made.
10. Contact with selected Mentee to inform them of their selection is to be made via their profile on the Slack channel and their provided email.
