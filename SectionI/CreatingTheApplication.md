# Step 4: Creating the Application (Week 4)

## Motivation
It is the responsibility of the MT to turn the rough version of the gathered requirements into an official Team Application, to be filled out by anyone interested in joining the participating Team.

## Procedure
After the meeting, the MT will use the gathered requirements to craft a Team Application using aidaform.com.

## Notes
* We have yet to create a Team Application that involves a code challenge but are currently working on such a Team Application.
