# Step 6: Initial Applicant Filtering (Week 6)

## Motivation
We have extra time while waiting for enough Applicants to complete the Team Application. It makes sense to do some filtering in the meantime so we donâ€™t have to do it all at once.

## Procedure
1. The MT defines the filtering criteria for the current Position. These are posted in the Agenda Note to be referenced during each round of filtering.
2. The current Applicants are split evenly among the present MT members. Each member is assigned a color and the rows on the Applicant results spreadsheet are highlighted those colors.
3. Each member checks the assigned Applicants against the filtering criteria. Any that do not meet the criteria are removed from the spreadsheet.
4. Once all current Applicants have been filtered, all rows are re-highlighted to a non-white color to indicate that they have already been verified for eligibility so that they do not get rechecked in a later filtering round. 

## Notes
* Is it worth the time to track ineligible Applicants rather than removing them from the spreadsheet and let them know why they were ineligible?
