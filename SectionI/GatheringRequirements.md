# Step 3: Gathering Requirements (Week 3)

## Motivation
The more precisely we can define the prerequisites and expectations for an available Position, the easier it is to attract suitable Candidates, and ultimately find the best Mentee we can.

## Procedure
The MT will schedule a meeting with the Mentor to discuss requirements.

The Mentor will be provided the following questions ahead of time in the Working Channel:
* Upcoming Initiative milestones?
* Actions being taken to achieve those milestones?
* Sticking points?
* Time consuming tasks?
* Something that could benefit from extra resources?
* Benefit to Mentee(s)?
* Prerequisites for a prospective Mentee?

These are not meant to be answered in the Working Channel. They are intended to better prepare the Mentor for the meeting.

For more technical positions, there may be a code challenge to determine whether the Applicant possesses the necessary skills. When possible, the design of the code challenge should begin in the requirement gathering meeting with the Mentorâ€™s help.

## Notes
* We need to gather feedback on the questions with an aim towards improving them over time.
